# Git-CMD-Reviews

This is for the purpose of Learning Git Commands over and over again.
And whenever I forgot how to used the specific Git Command that I needed from my work.

Common scenarios and some basic Git commands to solve the git issues.

Scenario #1 - If you commit to Master (main)branch but you committed a wrong message.

Scenario #2 - If you commit to Master (main)branch but you want to Add more file from your previous commit.

Scenario #3 - If you accidentally commit to Master (main)branch instead of commiting it in your feature branch.

Scenario #4 - If you wanted to Delete your Master (main)branch latest commit, the one you did not want to put in master (main)branch.

Scenario #5 - You remember that you still need a file or a piece of code that was on your deleted commit, but already reset the commit --hard.
